# American Baby Name Trends from 1920 to 2020 (DataCamp)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes U.S. baby name date from 1920 to 2020 using SQL. The goal was to explore how naming trends have changed across generations - identifying timeless classics vs. short-term fads and ranking popularity over time.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL/SQL
- Window Functions (RANK)
- CASE WHEN logic
- Filtering, Grouping, Aggregation
- Set operations (INTERSECT)

## Key Insights
- Classified names as **"Classic"** iff they appeared in 50 or more years, and **"Trendy"** if not.
- Ranked top 20 male names and evaluated the popularity of names like **Paul**.
- Identified which female names appeared in both **1920 and 2020**, using 'INTERSECT'.
